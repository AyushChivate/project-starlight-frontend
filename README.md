## Scripts
- `npm run dev`: Runs and automatically restarts the server whenever changes are made.
    - Uses nodemon, a tool that watches for file changes in the current directory and subdirectories.
    - When changes are detected, it automatically restarts the specified JavaScript file using the Node.js runtime.
    - This provides a more streamlined development workflow, as you can focus on coding without needing to manually restart the application every time you make changes.
    - Used during development.
- `npm run build`: Cleans the `./build` directory and builds the app into it.
- `npm run preview`: Runs the server once.
    - Directly executes the specified JavaScript file using the Node.js runtime. It's a one-time execution, and if you make changes to the code, you need to manually stop and restart the command each time to see the changes take effect.
    - Used in "production".
